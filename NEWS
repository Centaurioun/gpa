Noteworthy changes in CVS-HEAD
------------------------------------------------

* We have finished merging in the changes of the 0.5.0 release with the
  changes to CVS since 0.4.3.

* All the translations in the po/ directory, save the german one, are
  largely obsolete and should be updated before they can be used.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.5.0 (2002-02-25)
------------------------------------------------

 * The file selection dialog has been significantly changed from the
   standard GTK+ file selection dialog to look more like what users
   of MS-Windows are accustomed to.

 * "Show Details" in the menu of the file manager is now named
   "Verify Signatures", and it is now accessible through an icon in
   the tool bar, too.

 * Keyserver access via a direct HTTP request now allows for
   searching for keys on keyservers.

 * GPAPA's output is now gettext()ified.

 * The standard key is now remembered in `gpa.conf'.

 * The "Sign File" dialog has been simplified.

 * The creation of a backup copy of your public and private keys
   works now. It is remembered in `gpa.conf'. If a backup does not
   yet exist, the user is asked at startup to create one.

 * GPA now has a nice icon in the upper left corner of its window. :-)

 * Many bugfixes (for instance: crashes when signing files and keys,
   handling of spaces in file names, etc.).

 * Makefiles do contain `-mwindows' now to suppress the console
   window.

 * The "Help" menus is now called "Info". The license is displayed
   in the (unofficial) German translation now. (This should be
   improved to honor "locale" settings.)

 * GPA is now ready to compile with GTK+ version 2 once it is
   released.

 * In the key manager, there are now menu entries for key operations.

 * A secret key without a matching public key is now warned about.

 * Keys now can be imported from and exported to the MS Windows
   clipboard.

 * Secret keys can be imported now.

 * When a key is generated, a passphrase which is too stupid is
   warned about.

 * There now is an icon in the tool bar to switch from the keyring
   manager to the file manager.
 
 * GPA can now be compiled using a standard GNU toolchain.
   In particular it can be cross-compiled from GNU/Linux to
   mingw32/MS-Windows (which is what we did for the GnuPP CD),
   or compiled natively under MS-Windows using CygWin.
