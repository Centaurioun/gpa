Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.3 (2002-01-14)
------------------------------------------------

* The list of keyservers is now read form the file "keyservers" in the
  GPA configuration directory which by default is ~/.gnupg.  The new
  option keyserver may be used in the gpa.conf file to select the
  default keyserver - it implictly adds this server to the list of
  keyservers.
