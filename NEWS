Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.0 (2002-12-24)
------------------------------------------------

 * GPA now supports GnuPG 1.2 or later, thanks to it's use of GPGME.

 * All the user preferences are set from a single dialog, and automatically
 saved in gpa.conf, including the default keyserver and the use of
 advanced/simple UI mode.

 * The `--advanced-ui' command line options has been removed, as it is
 available within the program itself.

 * The new `-f' and `-k' options can be used to launch the keyring editor,
 the file manager, or both on startup.

 * All the user ID's in a key are now displayed in the `Details' section, and
 in most dialogs.

 * Key signatures are now displayed individually for each User ID, or in a
 global listing for the key.

 * The usual `Copy' and `Paste' commands can be used to import and export keys
 from the clipboard.

 * The `Edit key' option is now only available for private keys. Setting the
 ownertrust of a key is now an independent operation.

 * After every import operation, the user is informed of how many keys have
 been imported.

 * Errors or keyserver operations are now reported to the user.

 * The `Verify file' dialog has been completely revamped to allow
 verification of several files at the same time.

 * Added Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch and Spanish translations.

 * The user interface has been updated to use GTK+ 2.0 and stock items.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.5.0 (2002-02-25)
------------------------------------------------

 * The file selection dialog has been significantly changed from the
   standard GTK+ file selection dialog to look more like what users
   of MS-Windows are accustomed to.

 * "Show Details" in the menu of the file manager is now named
   "Verify Signatures", and it is now accessible through an icon in
   the tool bar, too.

 * Keyserver access via a direct HTTP request now allows for
   searching for keys on keyservers.

 * GPAPA's output is now gettext()ified.

 * The standard key is now remembered in `gpa.conf'.

 * The "Sign File" dialog has been simplified.

 * The creation of a backup copy of your public and private keys
   works now. It is remembered in `gpa.conf'. If a backup does not
   yet exist, the user is asked at startup to create one.

 * GPA now has a nice icon in the upper left corner of its window. :-)

 * Many bugfixes (for instance: crashes when signing files and keys,
   handling of spaces in file names, etc.).

 * Makefiles do contain `-mwindows' now to suppress the console
   window.

 * The "Help" menus is now called "Info". The license is displayed
   in the (unofficial) German translation now. (This should be
   improved to honor "locale" settings.)

 * GPA is now ready to compile with GTK+ version 2 once it is
   released.

 * In the key manager, there are now menu entries for key operations.

 * A secret key without a matching public key is now warned about.

 * Keys now can be imported from and exported to the MS Windows
   clipboard.

 * Secret keys can be imported now.

 * When a key is generated, a passphrase which is too stupid is
   warned about.

 * There now is an icon in the tool bar to switch from the keyring
   manager to the file manager.
 
 * GPA can now be compiled using a standard GNU toolchain.
   In particular it can be cross-compiled from GNU/Linux to
   mingw32/MS-Windows (which is what we did for the GnuPP CD),
   or compiled natively under MS-Windows using CygWin.
