In no particular order:

* Redo the key generation wizard stuff, as it is one ugly hack on top of
  another at this point.
** It should also print a progress indicator as the expert mode does.


* Dialogs should check user input and react to it.
** Don't allow the user to go on unless the input makes sense (particularly
   for the advanced key generation dialog and the import dialog).
** Select options automatically if it's clearly what the user intends
   For example, if a filename is written in the export dialog, obviously the
   user intends to export to a file. We should either check the "export to
   file" radio button automatically, or disable the file entry unless it's
   checked.

* The file decrypt operation should also show signatures, if available.

* Add more options to the "Edit key" dialog.
** Manage UID's.
** Manage subkeys.

* Check which options should be available from the toolbar. Draw new icons if
  needed.

* Documentation!

* Support a "File Status" (encrypted, signed, etc..) column in the
  filemanager, if GPGME allows it.

* [W32] Clipboard encryption

* Support drag and drop in the file manager

* There is no way to refresh selected keys from the keyserver.
  We might also want to have a scheduled refresh mode.  But that might
  be better implemented in gpg.
