In no particular order:

* Redo the key generation wizard stuff, as it is one ugly hack on top of
  another at this point.
** It should also print a progress indicator as the expert mode does.


* Dialogs should check user input and react to it.
** Don't allow the user to go on unless the input makes sense (particularly
   for the advanced key generation dialog and the import dialog).
** Select options automatically if it's clearly what the user intends
   For example, if a filename is written in the export dialog, obviously the
   user intends to export to a file. We should either check the "export to
   file" radio button automatically, or disable the file entry unless it's
   checked.

* The file decrypt operation should also show signatures, if available.

* Add more options to the "Edit key" dialog.
** Manage UID's.
** Manage subkeys.

* Check which options should be available from the toolbar. Draw new icons if
  needed.

* Documentation!

* Support a "File Status" (encrypted, signed, etc..) column in the
  filemanager, if GPGME allows it.

* [W32] Clipboard encryption

* Support drag and drop in the file manager

* There is no way to refresh selected keys from the keyserver.
  We might also want to have a scheduled refresh mode.  But that might
  be better implemented in gpg.

* MB:
** Add a beauty bar to filemanager (requires an icon corresponding to
   keyring.xpm).
** Add frame around filemanager list.
** Support receiving keys from keyservers for unknown certificates, by
   right click in "Signatures" tab of keyring manager and for all unknown
   keys in that list at once.
** Support getting plaintext from verify operation (should emit "created file"
   then).  NEEDED FOR CLIPBOARD of non clear text.
** Make signer selection list a bit larger than one row.
** clipboard: handle sensitivity of menu and toolbar items.
   Force armor.
** Change gpa_window_error to use gtk_label_set_line_wrap and remove
   all those newlines. 
** The sign, encrypt dialog and progress bar is not centered over the
   parent.  Maybe it is realized too early due to init vs constructor?
   It does get the right parent window parameter (checked that).
** Use GtkAction instead of manual GLists for update sensitivity and stuff.
