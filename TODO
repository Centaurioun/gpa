 - Implement the feature of differentiating between name and identifier of a
   file. (For "normal" files: name = identifier without pathnames; for
   mails: name = "Mail from/to ... [Date]

 ? gpapa_import_ownertrust doesn't yield an error message when the file to
   import from doesn't exist.


FOR VERSION 1.x:

 - Two possible ways of avoiding "modal" problems:
   1. All of the windows do exist all time; they're never destroyed, just
      hidden.
   2. Every window _really_ is an object (i.e. a struct in this case). The
      parameter pointers to pass to signal functions are not static, but
      fields of these structs. Every window gets a constructor (they're
      what is already existing in GPA 0.x) and a destructor, taking care of
      the parameter pointers.
   (Hell, what we need is a _really_ object oriented GUI lib!)

 - Implement a unified way of keeping clist selections in memory. Currently,
   it's a chaos...
