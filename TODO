 - All dummy functions are marked by a comment containing !!!.

 - Not yet done: Check for memory leaks.

 - Dialogs: Set them up to find their size and position independently of the
   window manager!
     wk: Why?

 - File dialogs: Let them _not_ be placed via mouse! Let them get to their
   standard position as every dialog else.
     wk: Why?

 - File dialogs: Initialization!

 - File dialogs: Check selected file for validity -- e.g. in the homedir
   dialog, if the selected path really is a directory.

 - Sign dialogs: There's one file_sign_dialog now for the file_sign,
   file_encrypt and key_openPublic_sign processes; in every case, it carries
   a lot of information that's not needed. It should be replaced by three
   independent dialogs, every one specialized for its own purpose. (Hell,
   GPA should be written in a _really_ object-oriented language...!)
     wk GTK+ is implements an complete messaging and inheritance system;
	aka OO.

 ? File clist: The file status isn't correctly recognized. Why?

 - Implement some widget with a progress bar -- signing and encrypting lasts
   quite long.

 - Up to now, all of the dialogs work on the list of currently selected
   files. They should better work on a copy of this list, made at the moment
   where the dialogs are created. Same thing with dialogs that work on a key
   list.

 - Implement the feature of differentiating between name and identifier of a
   file. (For "normal" files: name = identifier without pathnames; for
   mails: name = "Mail from/to ... [Date]")
   => In the file/show Detail dialog: Additional read-only entry with the
      complete file identifier! In the main file clist: tooltips with the
      complete file identifier(?).

 - Implement command line parameters to start GPA with
   - a given file or file list (thus enabling "Wind$$s Double-Clicking")
     (use function file_add from module filemenu.h of GPA)
   - a given key (import them at once and open key ring editor(?))

 - Insert new menu item: "Sign and save as"? Or remove all the "save as"
   menu items for other processes? (Symmetry!)

 - Public key ring editor:
   ? "Delete keys" still yields a segfault...

 - frameExpire: fill entryAfter and comboAfter with reasonable values,
   calculated from the key's expiry date.

 ? gpapa_import_ownertrust doesn't yield an error message when the file to
   import from doesn't exist.

 - In all "Sign as" dialogs: In the resp. clists, initialize the scrollbars
   as to present the selected row (AKA the default key).

 ? Set/get the list of default recipients.

 ? Set/get the home directory.

 ? Load/save options file.

 ? Show warranty information.

 ? Help texts.


FOR VERSION 2.x:

 - Implement a unified way of keeping clist selections in memory. Currently,
   it's a chaos...

 - Include import functions into key editors? (Hmm, better wait for feedback
   by users before starting this...)

 - Implement some command pattern or similar stuff to enable undo
   operations?
