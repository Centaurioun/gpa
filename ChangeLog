  Changed the copyright notices from FSF to G-N-U because we have not
  yet assigned the copyright and the G-N-U is the main authors.

  * configure.in (GPA_DATADIR): Create this macro.

  * VERSION: New because it is easier for the mkdiff script to move
  this file to the beginning, so that in trun patch can find the prereq
  * Makefile.am, configure.in: Adjusted for that.

  Version 0.3.1 has been released (without this entry :-()

  * configure.in: Removed -Wshadow because this hits on glib's usage of
  "index".

  Set version to 0.3 to indicate that we have a German
  translation and GNU formatted source (I don't like the last
  one but it is something which we can easily agree on).

  Added PO support.

  * configure.in: Add a few function checks. Fixed some hardcoded
  paths for the W32 version of Gtk+ - needs a better solution.

  GPA shows up on a Windows NT box and didn't crash.  This is a good
  reason to increase the version number.

  Version 0.2.0
