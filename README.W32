Some hints for compiling GPA for Windows:

- supported compiler: mingw cross-compiler
	(things are in flux. please ask on the
	developer mailing list for details)

- for Windows, GTK 1.3 is used requireing
	UTF-8 encoding of the .mo file.
	The conversion to UTF-8 is not
	automaized. Just do the following:

	sed -e "s/iso-8859-1/utf-8/" de.po > de_utf8.po
	recode latin1..utf-8 de_utf8.po
	msgfmt -o gpa.mo de_utf8.po
