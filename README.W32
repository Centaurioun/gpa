Some hints for compiling GPA for Windows:

- supported compiler: i686-w64-mingw32 and some older mingw versions.

- once you have the cross-compiler set up:
	./autogen.sh
	./autogen.sh --build-w32
	make
	and if you want to make gpa.exe lean:
	cd src
	rm gpa
	(compile gpa again with option -mwindows)
	mingw32 strip gpa
