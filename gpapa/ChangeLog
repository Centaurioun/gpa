  Replaced all concat() by xstrcat2().	Replaced some parameters named
  index by idx to avoid compiler warnings due to the index(3).

  * Makefile.am: New.

  Included the config.h as the header of each .c file.	Removed
  the libiberty.h header.

  * gpapa.c: re-implemented key ring extraction to keep them in
    memory.  This is much faster for now but does not scale well
    and must be replaced by something more sophisticated in the
    future.

Wed 26 Apr 2000 12:53 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  * m: create an `.a'.

  * upload: new file.

  * gpapaintern.c: gpapa_call_gnupg(): get the passphrase as an
    additional parameter instead of using a callback.

Tue 25 Apr 2000 26:25 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  Signing works.

  * gpapaintern.c: gpapa_call_gnupg() can handle passphrases.
    In fact for the way it is implemented, the callback is not
    necessary.	Do we want to keep it?

Tue 25 Apr 2000 14:00 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  Getting information about keys works, including fingerprints
  and such, but not including signatures and such.

Sun 23 Apr 2000 28:00 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  * gpapaintern.c: gpapa_call_gnupg() works.

Sat 22 Apr 2000 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  Started implementing.
