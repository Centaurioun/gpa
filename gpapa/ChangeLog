  * gpapa.c (gpapa_init): Add gpg parameter.
  (gpapa_private_get_gpg_program): New.
  * gpapaintern.c (gpapa_call_gnupg): Use this new function.

2000-05-16 19:53:49  Werner Koch  (wk@habibti.openit.de)

  Ran "indent -gnu -sc" on all source files.

2000-05-16 17:38:06  Werner Koch  (wk@habibti.openit.de)

  * gpapaintern.c (gpapa_call_gnupg) [MINGW32]: Some stuff works now.

2000-05-11 16:54:10  Werner Koch  (wk@habibti.openit.de)

  * gpapaintern.c (gpapa_call_gnupg) [MINGW32]: Dummy code for W32.
    Excluded one header for W32.

10 May 2000 26:56 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  All non-interactive parts of the public and secret key editors work.
  Encrypting, decrypting, and signing files works.

2000-05-02 19:45:30  Werner Koch  (wk@habibti.openit.de)

  Replaced all concat() by xstrcat2().	Replaced some parameters named
  index by idx to avoid compiler warnings due to the index(3).

2000-05-02 18:32:57  Werner Koch  (wk@habibti.openit.de)

  * Makefile.am: New.

  Included the config.h as the header of each .c file.	Removed
  the libiberty.h header.

Wed 26 Apr 2000 26:07 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  * gpapa.c: re-implemented key ring extraction to keep them in
    memory.  This is much faster for now but does not scale well
    and must be replaced by something more sophisticated in the
    future.

Wed 26 Apr 2000 12:53 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  * m: create an `.a'.

  * upload: new file.

Wed 26 Apr 2000 10:10 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  * gpapaintern.c: gpapa_call_gnupg(): get the passphrase as an
    additional parameter instead of using a callback.

Tue 25 Apr 2000 26:25 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  Signing works.

  * gpapaintern.c: gpapa_call_gnupg() can handle passphrases.
    In fact for the way it is implemented, the callback is not
    necessary.	Do we want to keep it?

Tue 25 Apr 2000 14:00 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  Getting information about keys works, including fingerprints
  and such, but not including signatures and such.

Sun 23 Apr 2000 28:00 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  * gpapaintern.c: gpapa_call_gnupg() works.

Sat 22 Apr 2000 Peter Gerwinski <peter.gerwinski@g-n-u.de>

  Started implementing.

Thu 20 Apr 2000 Markus Gerwinski <markus.gerwinski@sercon.de>

  Finished design.

Tue 18 Apr 2000 Markus Gerwinski <markus.gerwinski@sercon.de>

  Started with design.	Created the name "GPAPA".

Wed 5 Apr 2000 Markus Gerwinski <markus.gerwinski@sercon.de>

  Wrote down requirements.

Tu 16 May 2000 Markus Gerwinski <markus.gerwinski@sercon.de>

  - Did a lot of major changes in the header of gpapa_create_key_pair.
  - Detached methods set_expiry_date and set_expiry_time from class
    GpapaSecretKey and attached them to GpapaKey.
