How to build the DLL version for MS-Windows
-------------------------------------------

1. Install GTK+ for W32

   This is a bit tricky; basically you should have a directory setup like
   this:

   gpa/
   gpa/jnlib
   gpa/src
   gpa/intl
   gpa/po
   gpa/gpapa
   gtk+w32/
   gtk+w32/src
   gtk+w32/src/gtk+
   gtk+w32/src/gtk+/gdk
   gtk+w32/src/gtk+/gdk/win32
   gtk+w32/src/gtk+/gtk
   gtk+w32/src/glib
   gtk+w32/src/glib/gmodule
   gtk+w32/src/jpeg-6b
   gtk+w32/src/libpng-1.0.3
   gtk+w32/src/tiff-v3.4
   gtk+w32/src/tiff-v3.4/libtiff
   gtk+w32/src/zlib-1.1.3
   gtk+w32/src/intl
   gtk+w32/src/pthreads-snap-1999-05-30
   gtk+w32/lib

   It is no problem to use gpa-x.y.z instaead of gpa.  If you ahve a different
   setup you may have to chnage some constants in the Makefiles.  We will
   later change it to utilize autoconf.

   The header files of GTK+ may contain CR,LF sequences; you have to convert
   them back to Unix style LF only.


2. Configure and create GPA for that target:

   cd ..
   ./configure --target=i386--mingw32 #bw warum i386--minwg32 und nicht i386-mingw32 ?
   make

   At this point you should have a working version of GPA using
   a static libray.  If it failes in the src/ directory, don't care
   about it, you can still build the DLL.

3. Create the DLL

   cd gpapa
   ./build-dll

   If everything worked fine, you have now these file:

     gpapa.dll
     gpapa.imp

   That's it.
